# Bus-Tracker

This exercise from week 9 created a real time bus tracker based off of the MBTA data available. We tracked a specific route between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus.

# How to Run

## Step 1:
To make future improvements, download the files in the repository and open in the IDE of your choosing. I recommend Visual Studio Code or XCode.

## Step 2: 
Open the animation.JS file in the IDE. Here you can update the route, add additional bus lines, etc. Save any changes. 

## Step 3:
Optional to make changes to the style map in stylemap.css.

## Step 3: 
Open the bustracker.html file in a web browswer.
